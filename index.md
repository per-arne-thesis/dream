# Oracle and DVAE
We split this page in two sections, Oracle and DVAE. Each section presents videos and illustrations of each algorithms with a brief explaination.


## Oracle

### Actor Demo
The Oracle Actor demonstrates how Oracle manage to control many agents in a complex asrs system. 
Agents does not have safety controls, meaning that the agent must learn this manually.

## DVAE

# Actor Demo
The algorithm DVAE controls the taxi agents. The control process works but the agent risk catastrophic states.
